### Hello World, I'm Samuel 👋

- 📚 I'm a Computer Science undergrad student and my goal is to become a full-stack developer; 

- 📍 Santos - São Paulo (Brazil). 

#### What I'm focusing on 🎯

- 🌱 I am currently focused on learning about back-end development with Node.js. However I really enjoyed the fullstack package with Javascript/TypeScript, and as soon as possible I intend to study some frontend framework like React.js, Vue.js, Angular.js...
